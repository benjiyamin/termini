# Termini

Termini is a lightweight terminal emulator with a built-in virtual keyboard.
The emmulator GUI itself is built from tkinter to minimize dependencies. It is
constructed primarily for the PiTFT 2.8" screen for the Raspberry Pi but I will 
try to make it as flexble as possible. The code is minimal so one can easily 
understand and edit everythin. Cheers.


## Requirements

* [Python](http://python.org)

For dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
